Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based
mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect
the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge
this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new
benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced
mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each
with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a
difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD
qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both
PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our
evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a
stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%
(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals
that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their
ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common
errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative
study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection
than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language
stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that
establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While prior work on group recommender systems (GRSs) has primarily focused on
improving recommendation accuracy, most approaches assume static or predefined
groups, making them unsuitable for dynamic, real-world scenarios. We reframe
group formation as a core challenge in GRSs and propose DeepForm (Stochastic
Deep Graph Clustering for Practical Group Formation), a framework designed to
meet three key operational requirements: (1) the incorporation of high-order
user information, (2) real-time group formation, and (3) dynamic adjustment of
the number of groups. DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that
effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning
enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive
learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality,
efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.

Abstract: Prior to the close of the 2025 ARC Prize competition, the leading open source
approach - known as TRM, or Tiny Recursive Models - involved training a 7M
parameter recursive neural network on augmented variants of ARC tasks. That
approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but
required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the
competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model
that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on
competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was
pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on
4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model
was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to
reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such
post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model,
not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.

Abstract: The North Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal,
represents a vital source of livelihood for coastal communities, yet fishermen
often face uncertainty in locating productive fishing grounds. To address this
challenge, we present an AI-assisted framework for predicting Potential Fishing
Zones (PFZs) using oceanographic parameters such as sea surface temperature and
chlorophyll concentration. The approach is designed to enhance the accuracy of
PFZ identification and provide region-specific insights for sustainable fishing
practices. Preliminary results indicate that the framework can support
fishermen by reducing search time, lowering fuel consumption, and promoting
efficient resource utilization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial
applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques
to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models
have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks
that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.
Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require
extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits
adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and
sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot
learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting,
whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor
anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer
poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.
These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable
robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive
evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization
quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality
and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable
IoT systems.

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between
specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing
that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to
explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with
pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential
means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published
literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of
training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we
apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case
labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also
introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our
methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score
of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously
defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers
related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,
and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are
unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated
use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may
restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or
Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world
settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can
compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not
provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting
the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of
particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in
developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level
effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In
this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored
to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.
We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization
and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret
and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning
physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our
methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high
statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly
increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while
accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,
our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with
statistical validity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial
dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration
across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain
largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and
optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital
Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven
pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and
spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV,
sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns
deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and
enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with
segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of
0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear
degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement
learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance
planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and
establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the
approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement
management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent
coordination, and smart-city integration.

Abstract: We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's
preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for
personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user
preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a
text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized
alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few
queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on
the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and
selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated
responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and
noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the
best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving
personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign
in achieving personalized alignment.

Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental
challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states
and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random
local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration
methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI)
within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the
algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel
algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of
information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information
estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network
heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate
our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit
inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our
experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased
performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly,
without introducing extra hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Metamaterials are engineered materials composed of specially designed unit
cells that exhibit extraordinary properties beyond those of natural materials.
Complex engineering tasks often require heterogeneous unit cells to accommodate
spatially varying property requirements. However, designing heterogeneous
metamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and
strict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional
concurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization
problem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell
boundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures
from a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require
additional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we
propose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a
continuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly
addressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural
representation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and
local (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that
represents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across
the domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility
loss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.
Once trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high
resolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical
metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems
with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

Abstract: Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular
generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete,
unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models,
leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this
work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on
Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI
iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of
distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we
state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a
noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via
an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further
reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally,
in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on
molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph
generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.

Abstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is
essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation.
Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal
conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an
alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate
telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the
predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users.
In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework
for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live
telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless''
monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48
million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever
used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements
over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the
simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$
2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$
7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root
mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs
3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs
10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo
monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in
global shipping.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design
discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,
we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a
circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a
property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a
generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to
concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization
-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as
reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that
maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over
discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial
nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific
applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over
design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective
optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may
only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve
maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are
unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and
demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,
Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any
decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make
optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized
"search distribution" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation
of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization
across linked factors.

Abstract: Recent work in financial machine learning has shown the virtue of complexity:
the phenomenon by which deep learning methods capable of learning highly

While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial

remains largely unexplored. We conduct preliminary studies towards the
development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and
classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the
next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date
information) for a single day. We show that the ViT can learn seasonal patterns
and nonlinear features from the IV surface, suggesting a promising direction
for model development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen increasing popularity in enterprise
applications where AI agents and humans engage in objective-driven
interactions. However, these systems are difficult to evaluate: data may be
complex and unlabeled; human annotation is often impractical at scale; custom
metrics can monitor for specific errors, but not previously-undetected ones;
and LLM judges can produce unreliable results. We introduce the first set of
unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions, leveraging statistical
properties of unlabeled interaction data and using fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to
distributional shifts. We develop metrics for labeling user goals, measuring
goal completion, and quantifying LLM uncertainty without grounding evaluations
in human-generated ideal responses. Our approach is validated on open-domain
and task-specific interaction data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language
models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys
induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a
discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across
tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token
representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the
role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in
parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not
traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps
should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.
To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence
and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a
full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and
layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat
angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality
or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe
deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,
meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm
attention-induced curvature.

Abstract: For far too long, expressivity of graph neural networks has been measured
\emph{only} in terms of combinatorial properties. In this work we stray away
from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between
vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph
homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs
and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along
the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this
obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in
expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that
we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically
and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully
distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable
graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms
under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset.
  These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for
future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to
new frontiers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list
of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks.
This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is
to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the
presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are
vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where
bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning
process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust
algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our
knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.
This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no
cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out
outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.
Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence
in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence
of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing
only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and
extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong
robustness. In particular, it achieves a \(97.35\%\) and a \(91.60\%\) regret
improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich
and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the
statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,
causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare
signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,
creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine
this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods
operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;
locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote
efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of
self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation
space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these
principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained
within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the
likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,
anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms
that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional
problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion
detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the
natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing
only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous
locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring
both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and
environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With
application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,
co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.
However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under
high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency
when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these
challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and
sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically
relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we
introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables
DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while
satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.
Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the
reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts
to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.
Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when
validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including
warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our
method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%
higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This
sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone
towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.

Abstract: The uprising of deep learning methodology and practice in recent years has
brought about a severe consequence of increasing carbon footprint due to the
insatiable demand for computational resources and power. The field of text
analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of
monopolizing methodology. In this paper, the original TF-IDF algorithm has been
modified, and Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CTF-IDF) has
been proposed for data preprocessing. This paper primarily discusses the
effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with
CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The
introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics
pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive
application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon
footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also
exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model
accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this
paper.

Abstract: While backpropagation--reverse-mode automatic differentiation--has been
extraordinarily successful in deep learning, it requires two passes (forward
and backward) through the neural network and the storage of intermediate
activations. Existing gradient estimation methods that instead use forward-mode
automatic differentiation struggle to scale beyond small networks due to the
high variance of the estimates. Efforts to mitigate this have so far introduced
significant bias to the estimates, reducing their utility. We introduce a
gradient estimation approach that reduces both bias and variance by
manipulating upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions. It
shows promising results and has the potential to scale to larger networks,
indeed performing better as the network width is increased. Our understanding
of this method is facilitated by analyses of bias and variance, and their
connection to the low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients.

Abstract: Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic
discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core
challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically
implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and
structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to
enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative
trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed
manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising
scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This
physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological
priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.
Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a
new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean
Square Deviation of 0.99 {\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%
improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest
reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored
in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers
consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root
Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain
Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By
aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness
and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically
faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

Abstract: Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on
various tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In
this paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted
assumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional
independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap
and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our
proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of
different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data
augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of
the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples
together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we
develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive
learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without
relying on additional modules. Code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from
different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting
critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs
and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while
failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast,
pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated
strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their
potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally
different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly
(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities
through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss
that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous
time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module
that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on
them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference
time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.
By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap
between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.
Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones
show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a
scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a
simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However,
when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly
assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce
Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack
frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial
examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and
natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the
original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an
automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external
heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate
strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this
work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's
robustness. We release our code and data at

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications,
including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate
dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic
computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this
work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these
limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that
entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies
that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values
exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an
efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of
dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the
implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality.
Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in
spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the
non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and
well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four
spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or
superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both
memory usage and computational time.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a key strategy for enhancing the generalizability of
deep learning models in real-world scenarios, where test distributions often
diverge significantly from the training domain. However, conventional
approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require
model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or
resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on
batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but
they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained
to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration
(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation
distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the
full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures
employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of
estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a
robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our
method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling
unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,
CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR
achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing
test-time adaptation baselines. These results highlight AQR's potential for
deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data
distributions.

Abstract: In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks,
state-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved
impressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts
deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for
lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model
compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework
where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors
derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a
pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization
strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection
performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT
botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with
respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable
decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original
unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in
size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the
practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse
domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with
negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address
these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt
vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in
distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote
diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality
constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and
facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a
prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal
complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments
under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results
show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring
only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and
scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation
models.

Abstract: Uncovering cause-effect relationships from observational time series is
fundamental to understanding complex systems. While many methods infer static
causal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where
relationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics
requires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning
method for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler
and Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic
representations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive
Dependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing
datapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits
a unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal
causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human
motion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying,
time-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena.

Abstract: With the on-going integration of machine learning systems into the everyday
social life of millions the notion of fairness becomes an ever increasing
priority in their development. Fairness notions commonly rely on protected
attributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses
on discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The
literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression
-- we refer to this as \emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common
strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been
explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear
encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly
extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for
kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes. We demonstrate
that our novel approach in conjunction with Support Vector Regression (SVR)
provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets in
comparisons to other contemporary methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn
diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods
often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on
increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the
distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --
particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across
varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is
essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a
framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key
idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,
thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By
capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse
periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We
further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream
tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill
discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's
repertoire. Our code and demos are available at

Abstract: AlphaZero-like Monte Carlo Tree Search systems, originally introduced for
two-player games, dynamically balance exploration and exploitation using neural
network guidance. This combination makes them also suitable for classical
search problems. However, the original method of training the network with
simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the
early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience
Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from
the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER
(\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing
easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and
trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that
the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of
pure supervised or reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Expressive Neural Network
(ENN), a multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parametrized
using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Building upon previous work that
demonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we
now emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The
DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated
representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows
direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we
propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients
with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across
classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.
Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,
thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of
signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced
trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Various data modalities are common in real-world applications (e.g.,
electronic health records, medical images and clinical notes in healthcare). It
is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various
information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to
appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a
joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the
Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities
and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the
joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is
underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the
interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution
and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel
copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the
joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions
among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align
the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a
Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint
distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and

in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability
of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range
from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled
sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new
methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as
generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we
review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent
trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a
novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect
the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the
survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation
practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open

Abstract: Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations,
but they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from
nowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address
this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our
framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update
physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of
constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and
positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%
computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We
further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small
oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long
prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft
violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth
vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,
CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.
Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior
an intrinsic property of the learning process.

Abstract: Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers
provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration
functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple
theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight
motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard
temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies
in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often
coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff
can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing
and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains
over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and
easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an
attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling
implementations.

Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by
the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on
data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which
accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This
results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To
address this, this paper introduces \ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data
collection as a closed-loop control problem. \ac{FCDC} continuously
approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online
probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on
feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this
feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and
exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from
accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \ac{FCDC} on
a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \ac{FCDC}
produces more balanced datasets by $\SI{25.9}{\percent}$ while reducing data
storage by $\SI{39.8}{\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data
collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a
passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the
core of data-centric AI.

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the
physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,
resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of
AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to
automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical
bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of
explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of
the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for
sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs
a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based
agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design
goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the
target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation
strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.
The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity
and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from
pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system
learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate
convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog
design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents
serve as transparent design assistants.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
central to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements
are sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or
discontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive
labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to
failure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a
novel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome
these limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both
point measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.
This framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient
fields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator
decoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies
purely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds
via efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a
priori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse
problems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based
measurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO
consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under
severe noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under
varying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to
out-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and
powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across
computational science domains.

Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging
domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,
yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we
reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:
cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts
a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)
penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.
Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled
formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty
samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment
between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we
propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the
reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to
replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,
and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised
learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when
unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass
autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts
later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and
persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three
compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from
iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation;
input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the
gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B
unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched
settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag
and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by
repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation
cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

Abstract: As cloud computing and microservice architectures become increasingly
prevalent, API rate limiting has emerged as a critical mechanism for ensuring
system stability and service quality. Traditional rate limiting algorithms,
such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to
adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes
an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that
dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid
architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a
Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states
and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction.
Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate
that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency
reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load
scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million
daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method,
with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual
interventions.

Abstract: From molecular imaging to wireless communications, the ability to align and
reconstruct signals from multiple misaligned observations is crucial for system
performance. We study the problem of multi-reference alignment (MRA), which
arises in many real-world problems, such as cryo-EM, computer vision, and, in
particular, wireless communication systems. Using a probabilistic approach to
model MRA, we find a new algorithm that uses relative poses as nuisance
variables to marginalize out -- thereby removing the global symmetries of the
problem and allowing for more direct solutions and improved convergence. The
decentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by
avoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency.
Both proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental
settings.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing
in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines
graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is
abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and
edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph
convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model
dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On
this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal
evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations
are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving
the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring
functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified
modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which
enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of
potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed
from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental
disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results
show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC,
Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic
topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new
technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a
methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

Abstract: Sparse decision tree learning provides accurate and interpretable predictive
models that are ideal for high-stakes applications by finding the single most
accurate tree within a (soft) size limit. Rather than relying on a single
"best" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying
structures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich
explanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy
stakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into
the objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard,
enumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce
SORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the
Rashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior.
Our experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of
magnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute
Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports
post-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered)
objectives. Together, these advances make exploring Rashomon sets more
practical in real-world applications.

Abstract: In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention
recognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike
traditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora
and often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach
eliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of
multi-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named
DMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different
transport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to
obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using
a novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and
maximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline
is demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation
context. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%
and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers
and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that
Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over
alternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%
gain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system
seamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,
traffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation
domain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents
without costly manual labelling.

Abstract: The rise of the machine learning (ML) model economy has intertwined markets
for training datasets and pre-trained models. However, most pricing approaches
still separate data and model transactions or rely on broker-centric pipelines
that favor one side. Recent studies of data markets with externalities capture
buyer interactions but do not yield a simultaneous and symmetric mechanism
across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers. We propose a unified
data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single
system. A supply-side mapping transforms dataset payments into buyer-visible
model quotations, while a demand-side mapping propagates buyer prices back to
datasets through Shapley-based allocation. Together, they form a closed loop
that links four interactions: supply-demand propagation in both directions and
mutual coupling among buyers and among sellers. We prove that the joint
operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence,
uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments
demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with
broker-centric and one-sided baselines. The code is available on
https://github.com/HongrunRen1109/Triple-Win-Pricing.

Abstract: Integrating different molecular layers, i.e., multiomics data, is crucial for
unraveling the complexity of diseases; yet, most deep generative models either
prioritize predictive performance at the expense of interpretability or enforce
interpretability by linearizing the decoder, thereby weakening the network's
nonlinear expressiveness. To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS:
Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse
Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive
performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability
without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent
factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker
discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent
space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each
omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the
representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder.
In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and
classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations,
demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist
in multiomics representation learning.

Abstract: In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the environment
exhibits inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning
efficiency. This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for
incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a
symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI),
which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and
transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum
information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly
quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a
customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm
the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves
significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These
findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more
sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)

modern applications demand longer and more complex inputs. Existing caching
techniques either preserve accuracy with low cache reuse or improve reuse at
the cost of degraded reasoning quality. We present RAGBoost, an efficient RAG
system that achieves high cache reuse without sacrificing accuracy through
accuracy-preserving context reuse. RAGBoost detects overlapping retrieved items
across concurrent sessions and multi-turn interactions, using efficient context
indexing, ordering, and de-duplication to maximize reuse, while lightweight
contextual hints maintain reasoning fidelity. It integrates seamlessly with
existing LLM inference engines and improves their prefill performance by 1.5-3X

Abstract: Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework to resolve a central paradox in
modern machine learning: When is it better to use less data? This question has
become critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et
al., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et
al., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with
small, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies
where an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their
difficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for
test error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing
when and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In
contrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions,
small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical
conditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data
size and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results
on ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy
and can even mitigate model collapse. Furthermore, our framework provides a
principled explanation for the contradictory curation strategies recently
observed in LLM mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable
alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned
critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of
trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the
necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first
systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning
environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through
controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we
reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for
long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in
short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be
effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except
in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting
(gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting
limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes.
These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical
control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to
learned value functions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model without sharing their private data. However, the presence of malicious
(Byzantine) clients poses significant challenges to the robustness of FL,
particularly when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous. In this
paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL optimization problem that
incorporates adaptive weighting into the aggregation process. Unlike
conventional approaches, our formulation treats aggregation weights as
learnable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the global model
parameters. To solve this optimization problem, we develop an alternating
minimization algorithm with strong convergence guarantees under adversarial
attack. We analyze the Byzantine resilience of the proposed objective. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches, particularly in settings with highly heterogeneous data
and a large proportion of malicious clients.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central
goal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning
algorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,
which have been consistently associated with improved generalization
performance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and
generalization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with
a non-negative, $\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in
this fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur
trivial $\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.
Then, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural
''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),
designed to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient
Descent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which
performs gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we
prove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,
the population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\Omega(1)$,
indicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware
gradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient
approximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although
it minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also
incur population risk $\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper
bounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.

pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and
limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific
notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target
imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we
use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit
within a 128k-token window.
  On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art
on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically
with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes
but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs
can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when
paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating
further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex
calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning
algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the
number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While
neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent
tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more
parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,
we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor
decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action
spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key
innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with
visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high
uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate
a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage
exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to
frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks
demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL
approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for
resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling
costs are high.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action
demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements
severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide
only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is
often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation
reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining
deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from
observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation
Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs
expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence
mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.
This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training
while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further
extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to
tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a
challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.
HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging
procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to
expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns
compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit
imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous
action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging
expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter
sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset
sizes and hyperparameter configurations.

Abstract: In this paper, we formalize the almost sure convergence of $Q$-learning and
linear temporal difference (TD) learning with Markovian samples using the Lean
4 theorem prover based on the Mathlib library. $Q$-learning and linear TD are
among the earliest and most influential reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research
topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing
attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence
in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework
developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other
modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully
formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at

Abstract: Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have revolutionized predictive
machine learning for tabular data. At the same time, the driving factors of
this revolution are hard to understand. Existing open-source tabular foundation
models are implemented in complicated pipelines boasting over 10,000 lines of
code, lack architecture documentation or code quality. In short, the
implementations are hard to understand, not beginner-friendly, and complicated
to adapt for new experiments. We introduce nanoTabPFN, a simplified and
lightweight implementation of the TabPFN v2 architecture and a corresponding
training loop that uses pre-generated training data. nanoTabPFN makes tabular
foundation models more accessible to students and researchers alike. For
example, restricted to a small data setting it achieves a performance
comparable to traditional machine learning baselines within one minute of
pre-training on a single GPU (160,000x faster than TabPFN v2 pretraining). This
eliminated requirement of large computational resources makes pre-training
tabular foundation models accessible for educational purposes. Our code is

Abstract: The integration of IoT devices in healthcare introduces significant security
and reliability challenges, increasing susceptibility to cyber threats and
operational anomalies. This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework
for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device
anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning
models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning
(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised
learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph
Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The
comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,
precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost
achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly
detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.
LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For
attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score
with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.
GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.
These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective
anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and
device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,
minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of
medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven
healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without
online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed
in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value
estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive
Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable
transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit
behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency
signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that
(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is
high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online
experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation
from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and
accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ
consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving
faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our
results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and
practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using
policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods
typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each
prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),
reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.
  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages
for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we
propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt
means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --
particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we
construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance
policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a
drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no
additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines
consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to
lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring
their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to
mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and
intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these
protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current
attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we
systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset
of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,
including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical
actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for
incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety
from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols
and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of
when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially
improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety
to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our
strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack
policies access to protocol internals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet
are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema
mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for
individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental
limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning
patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a
multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition
into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,
and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent
contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models
and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.
First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the
strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model
scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and
conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent
effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev
20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or
analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing
report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits
persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%
discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning
enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%
for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide
when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while
enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product
categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent
framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels
via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM
evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item
recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude
3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers
the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most
favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among
open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in
structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in
lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with
actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various
scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.
Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order
to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this
context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or
false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic
knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what
is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal
is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of
knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they
internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful
universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,
classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight
fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,
challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we
develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating
whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world
populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social
behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not
seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the
context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that
language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer
1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional
(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also
limited.

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+
context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory
to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV
demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,
these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using
frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static
graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it
difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention
algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such
techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well
understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this
paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be
deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way
tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators
running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real
production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage
and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and
LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation
of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system
with static graphs and continuous batching.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,
inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on
assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with
LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to
the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any
specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing
principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in
how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based
monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are
generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across
numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task
independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model
capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety
guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,
long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.
We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and
professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.
Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for
safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist
artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the
miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to
participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such
setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,
formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it
will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the
original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results
reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA
models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA
accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving
literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion
of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for
more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the
errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,
and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements
and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to
the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the
original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the
autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a
higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the
field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success
modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models. Our dataset is available

Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements
in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant
importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily
manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and
other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order
methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient
information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are
ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the
rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial
improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.
Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language
models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we
choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel
approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large
language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical
Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further
utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the
multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific
tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic
design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs
generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on
many problem instances.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely
constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper
proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard
LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework
employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a
fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused
Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling
of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario
adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,
the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a
specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are
grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates
information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly
higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the
baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk
test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,
validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.
This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building
high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,
leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional
methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,
we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework
that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces
specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine
design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the
aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of
three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems
Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.
The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical
requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer
leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose
candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and
provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge
graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the
manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics
such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how
collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can

Abstract: Generative AI assistants offer significant potential to enhance productivity,
streamline information access, and improve user experience in enterprise
contexts. In this work, we present Summit Concierge, a domain-specific AI
assistant developed for Adobe Summit. The assistant handles a wide range of
event-related queries and operates under real-world constraints such as data
sparsity, quality assurance, and rapid deployment. To address these challenges,
we adopt a human-in-the-loop development workflow that combines prompt
engineering, retrieval grounding, and lightweight human validation. We describe
the system architecture, development process, and real-world deployment
outcomes. Our experience shows that agile, feedback-driven development enables
scalable and reliable AI assistants, even in cold-start scenarios.

Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be
interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from
minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality
Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine
other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing
human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from
LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >
0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on
semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms
trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that
LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five
responses into natural language personality summaries through information
selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.
Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these
summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality
factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item
importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely
redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to
original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,
second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs
can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from
minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a
powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their
emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice,
and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user
interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and
unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a
structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great
human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work,
we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a
human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a
graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page
coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and
MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors
through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.
Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility
auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world
impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking
core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language
models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation into the
parameterized complexity of explanation problems in various machine learning
(ML) models. Contrary to the prevalent black-box perception, our study focuses
on models with transparent internal mechanisms. We address two principal types
of explanation problems: abductive and contrastive, both in their local and
global variants. Our analysis encompasses diverse ML models, including Decision
Trees, Decision Sets, Decision Lists, Boolean Circuits, and ensembles thereof,
each offering unique explanatory challenges. This research fills a significant
gap in explainable AI (XAI) by providing a foundational understanding of the
complexities of generating explanations for these models. This work provides
insights vital for further research in the domain of XAI, contributing to the
broader discourse on the necessity of transparency and accountability in AI
systems.

Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for
environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and
reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite
human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:
most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple
rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to
achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized
by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a
model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played
at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and
equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also
outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning
abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,
randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class
human players.
