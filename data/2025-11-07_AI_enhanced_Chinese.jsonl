To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions.

Conventional explainability techniques, such as\nSHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their\nexplanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This\nstudy addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks\nthat recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit\nmodels. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via\nXGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation\nreweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP\nrebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate\ncalibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked\nagainst static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,\nF1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness\n(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,\nparticularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially\nimprove temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic\ngroups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including\ncounterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and\nproxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under\nreal-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability\nas a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and\nethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any\ndomain where decision models evolve with population change.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding\nexpert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its\npreprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the\ncharacteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated\nusing the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were\ncompared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnU?Net model achieved a\nmean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and\noutperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous\nstudies.

Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a\nnatural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While\nthe problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent\nsettings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In\nthis work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized\nmulti-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the\ntransition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying\nnovel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.\nOur main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on\nthe construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our\nregret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the\ninherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning\ncomplexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of\nefficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our method is\nindependent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method\nis environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,\nleading to instability in performance for individual goals.

To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of\nlanguage models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion\nmodel (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens\nout-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,\nthere is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling\nthese models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling\nperformance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but\nthese are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we\ngive a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true\ndistribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any\nunmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory\nof univariate function approximation.\n  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and\nupper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation\nin principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show\nthat it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori\nknowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we\nalso demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of\nwell-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,\nits total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some\nnatural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss\nin performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
